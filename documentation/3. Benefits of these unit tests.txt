Benefits:

	Development
		- Ensure that the requirements are implemented, without manual tests of the code.
		- Focus on one requirement at a time.
		- Make sure nothing breaks while refactoring. 
	Refactoring
	    - Can run automatic tests to validate that the code still fulfills the original requirements.
	New requirements
	    - Make sure the old requirements that you still want to keep are valid for the new codebase.
